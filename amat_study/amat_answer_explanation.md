## Q1

### Problem Restatement
We want to determine if $(zw > 0)$.  
We are given two statements:

1. $(z + w^3 = 20)$  
2. $(z > 0)$

---

### Step 1: Consider Statement (1) Alone
From (1):  
$[
z = 20 - w^3
]$

This equation links $(z)$ and $(w)$, but it doesn’t tell us the sign of either variable individually.  
- If $(w = 2)$, then $(z = 20 - 8 = 12)$, so $(zw = 24 > 0)$.  
- If $(w = -2)$, then $(z = 20 - (-8) = 28)$, so $(zw = -56 < 0)$.  

Thus, **Statement (1) alone is insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Consider Statement (2) Alone
Statement (2) says $(z > 0)$.  
But we know nothing about $(w)$.  
- If $(w > 0)$, then $(zw > 0)$.  
- If $(w < 0)$, then $(zw < 0)$.  

So **Statement (2) alone is insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
From (1): $(z = 20 - w^3)$.  
From (2): $(z > 0)$.  

So:
$[
20 - w^3 > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad w^3 < 20
]$

This means $(w < \sqrt[3]{20} \approx 2.71)$.  
But $(w)$ could still be positive or negative.  
- If $(w = 2)$, then $(z = 12)$, so $(zw = 24 > 0)$.  
- If $(w = -2)$, then $(z = 28)$, so $(zw = -56 < 0)$.  

Even with both statements, we cannot determine the sign of $(zw)$.

---

### Final Answer
The information given is **insufficient** to determine whether $(zw)$ is positive.  

---

## Q2


### Problem Restatement
We know the ratio of Brand Y to Brand X computers is $(5:6)$.  
We want to find the **number of Brand Y computers**.

---

### Step 1: Express the Ratio
Let:
- Brand Y computers = $(5k)$  
- Brand X computers = $(6k)$  

for some positive integer $(k)$.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (1)
Statement (1): Brand X computers exceed Brand Y computers by 80.  
$[
6k - 5k = 80 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 80
]$  
So Brand Y computers = $(5k = 400)$.  

✅ Statement (1) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Analyze Statement (2)
Statement (2): Total computers = 880.  
$[
5k + 6k = 11k = 880 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 80
]$  
So Brand Y computers = $(5k = 400)$.  

✅ Statement (2) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 4: Combine Statements
Since each statement alone is sufficient, combining them is unnecessary.

---

### Final Answer
Each statement alone is sufficient.  
Correct choice: **D** (Each statement alone is sufficient).

---


## Q3


### Problem Restatement
Ann saves $(x)$ dollars per week, Beth saves $(y)$ dollars per week.  
We want the **total amount saved per week**:  
$[
x + y
]$

---

### Step 1: Analyze Statement (1)
Beth saves $5 more than Ann:  
$[
y = x + 5
]$

So total savings:  
$[
x + y = x + (x+5) = 2x + 5
]$

We don’t know $(x)$.  
❌ Statement (1) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (2)
Ann saves in 6 weeks what Beth saves in 5 weeks:  
$[
6x = 5y \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \tfrac{6}{5}x
]$

So total savings:  
$[
x + y = x + \tfrac{6}{5}x = \tfrac{11}{5}x
]$

We don’t know $(x)$.  
❌ Statement (2) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
From (1): $(y = x + 5)$.  
From (2): $(y = \tfrac{6}{5}x)$.  

Set equal:  
$[
x + 5 = \tfrac{6}{5}x
]$

Multiply through:  
$[
5x + 25 = 6x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 25
]$

Then:  
$[
y = x + 5 = 30
]$

So total savings:  
$[
x + y = 25 + 30 = 55
]$

✅ Together, the statements are **sufficient**.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **C** (Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient).

---



## Q4

### Problem Restatement
We know:
$[
\text{Total price of } n \text{ shares} = 12{,}000
]$
So:
$[
\text{Price per share} = \frac{12{,}000}{n}
]$

We want the price per share.

---

### Step 1: Analyze Statement (1)
If the price per share had been $1 more, the total price would have been $300 more.

Let price per share = $(p)$.  
So:
$[
n \cdot (p+1) = 12{,}000 + 300 = 12{,}300
]$

But we also know:
$[
n \cdot p = 12{,}000
]$

Subtract:
$[
n(p+1) - np = 12{,}300 - 12{,}000
]$
$[
n = 300
]$

So:
$[
p = \frac{12{,}000}{300} = 40
]$

✅ Statement (1) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (2)
If the price per share had been $2 less, the total price would have been 5% less.

So:
$[
n(p-2) = 0.95 \cdot 12{,}000 = 11{,}400
]$

But we also know:
$[
np = 12{,}000
]$

Subtract:
$[
np - n(p-2) = 12{,}000 - 11{,}400
]$
$[
2n = 600 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = 300
]$

So:
$[
p = \frac{12{,}000}{300} = 40
]$

✅ Statement (2) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements
Each statement alone already gives the answer, so combining is unnecessary.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **D** (Each statement alone is sufficient).

---


## Q5

### Problem Restatement
Total cost of the dinner = ?  
It was shared equally by $(k)$ of the $(n)$ employees.  
We want the **total cost**.

---

### Step 1: Analyze Statement (1)
Each of the $(k)$ employees paid $19.  
So:

$[
\text{Total cost} = 19k
]$

But we don’t know \(k\).  
❌ Statement (1) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (2)
If the cost had been shared by $(k+1)$ employees, each would have paid $18.  
So:

$[
\text{Total cost} = 18(k+1)
]$

But we don’t know \(k\).  
❌ Statement (2) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
From (1):  
$[
\text{Total cost} = 19k
]$

From (2):  
$[
\text{Total cost} = 18(k+1)
]$

Set equal:  
$[
19k = 18(k+1)
]$
$[
19k = 18k + 18
]$
$[
k = 18
]$

So:  
$[
\text{Total cost} = 19k = 19 \cdot 18 = 342
]$

✅ Together, the statements are **sufficient**.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **C** (Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient).

---


Q6

### Problem Restatement
We want the value of $(y)$, given that $(x)$ and $(y)$ are integers.

---

### Step 1: Statement (1) Alone
$[
xy = 27
]$

Possible integer factor pairs of 27:  
$((x,y) = (1,27), (27,1), (3,9), (9,3), (-1,-27), (-27,-1), (-3,-9), (-9,-3))$.

So $(y)$ could be many values.  
❌ Statement (1) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Statement (2) Alone
$[
x = y^2
]$

This only relates $(x)$ and $(y)$. But without more information, $(y)$ could be many integers (positive or negative).  
❌ Statement (2) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
From (2): $(x = y^2)$.  
Plug into (1):  
$[
y^2 \cdot y = 27 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y^3 = 27
]$

So:  
$[
y = 3
]$

✅ Together, the statements are **sufficient**.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **C** (Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient).

---


## Q7

### Problem Restatement
We want the average of $(x)$ and $(y)$:  
$[
\frac{x+y}{2}
]$

---

### Step 1: Statement (1) Alone
The average of $(x)$ and $(2y)$ is 10:  
$[
\frac{x + 2y}{2} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x + 2y = 20
]$

This is one equation with two unknowns.  
We cannot determine $(\frac{x+y}{2})$ uniquely.  
❌ Statement (1) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Statement (2) Alone
The average of $(2x)$ and $(7y)$ is 32:  
$[
\frac{2x + 7y}{2} = 32 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2x + 7y = 64
]$

This is also one equation with two unknowns.  
We cannot determine $(\frac{x+y}{2})$ uniquely.  
❌ Statement (2) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
We now have a system of equations:

1. $(x + 2y = 20)$  
2. $(2x + 7y = 64)$

Solve (1) for $(x)$:  
$[
x = 20 - 2y
]$

Substitute into (2):  
$[
2(20 - 2y) + 7y = 64
]$  
$[
40 - 4y + 7y = 64
]$  
$[
3y = 24 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 8
]$

Then:  
$[
x = 20 - 2(8) = 4
]$

So:  
$[
\frac{x+y}{2} = \frac{4+8}{2} = 6
]$

✅ Together, the statements are **sufficient**.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **C** (Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient).

## Q8


### Statement (1)
- 40% of the total donations came from corporate sources.
- This tells us the proportion but not the actual amount.  
- Alone, it’s insufficient.

### Statement (2)
- $1.5 million came from noncorporate donations.
- This gives us a dollar amount, but not the total.  
- Alone, it’s insufficient.

### Combining (1) and (2)
- If 40% came from corporate donations, then 60% came from noncorporate donations.
- Statement (2) says noncorporate donations = $1.5 million.
- So, 60% of the total = $1.5 million.
- Total donations = $(\frac{1.5}{0.6} = 2.5)$ million.

✅ Together, the statements are sufficient to determine the total amount donated: **$2.5 million**.

---

## Q9


### Statement (1)
- Rule: After the first two terms, each term = average of the last two preceding terms.  
- This defines the recurrence relation, but without knowing the actual values of the first two terms, we cannot compute the sequence.  
- **Insufficient alone.**

### Statement (2)
- The average of the first three terms = 10.  
- So $((a_1 + a_2 + a_3)/3 = 10 \implies a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 30)$.  
- But we don’t know how the terms are related, so we cannot determine the fourth term.  
- **Insufficient alone.**

### Combining (1) and (2)
- From (1): $(a_3 = (a_1 + a_2)/2)$.  
- Plug into (2): $(a_1 + a_2 + (a_1 + a_2)/2 = 30)$.  
- That simplifies to $(1.5(a_1 + a_2) = 30 \implies a_1 + a_2 = 20)$.  
- Then $(a_3 = 10)$.  
- From (1): (a_4 = (a_2 + a_3)/2 = (a_2 + 10)/2)$.  

Now the sum of the first four terms:  
$[
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 20 + 10 + \frac{a_2 + 10}{2} = 30 + \frac{a_2 + 10}{2}
]$

This still depends on $(a_2)$. Without knowing $(a_2)$ individually, we cannot fix the sum.  

### Conclusion
Even together, the statements are **not sufficient** to determine the sum of the first four terms.  

---

## Q10

### Statement (1)
- $(101 < N < 103)$.  
- Since $(N)$ is an integer, the only possible value is $(N = 102)$.  
- **Sufficient.**

### Statement (2)
- $(202 < 2N < 206)$.  
- Divide through by 2: $(101 < N < 103)$.  
- Again, the only integer value is $(N = 102)$.  
- **Sufficient.**

### Combining
- Each statement alone already determines $(N = 102)$.  
- So combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:
**(D)** — Each statement alone is sufficient.  

---

## Q11

### Statement (1): $(a < c < e)$  
- This only gives us a partial ordering among three of the numbers.  
- We don’t know where $(b)$ and $(d)$ fit relative to them.  
- So we cannot determine whether $(d)$ is the median.  
- **Insufficient.**

### Statement (2): $(b < d < c)$  
- This gives us a partial ordering among three numbers.  
- But again, we don’t know where $(a)$ and $(e)$ fit.  
- So we cannot determine whether $(d)$ is the median.  
- **Insufficient.**

### Combining (1) and (2)  
- From (1): $(a < c < e)$.  
- From (2): $(b < d < c)$.  
- Together we know: $(a < c < e)$ and $(b < d < c)$.  
- So the combined order is: $(a, b, d, c, e)$ (with some flexibility between $(a)$ and $(b)$, since we don’t know which is smaller).  

Now, the median of five numbers is the third number when arranged in ascending order.  
- If $(a < b)$, the order is $(a, b, d, c, e)$. Median = $(d)$.  
- If $(b < a)$, the order is $(b, a, d, c, e)$. Median = $(d)$.  

In both cases, the median is indeed $(d)$.  
- **Together, sufficient.**

---

### Correct Answer Choice:
**(C)** — Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient.

## Q12



### Statement (1)  
- $(n)$ is the product of two different prime numbers.  
- So $(n = p \cdot q)$, where $(p)$ and $(q)$ are distinct primes.  
- The number of positive divisors of $(n)$ is $((1+1)(1+1) = 4)$.  
- Divisors are: $(1, p, q, pq)$.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2)  
- $(n)$ and $(2^3 = 8)$ are each divisible by the same number of positive integers.  
- The number of divisors of 8 is 4 (since $(8 = 2^3)$, divisors count = $(3+1 = 4)$).  
- So $(n)$ also has 4 divisors.  
- The only integers with exactly 4 divisors are:  
  - The cube of a prime $(p^3)$, divisors: $(1, p, p^2, p^3)$.  
  - The product of two distinct primes $(p \cdot q)$, divisors: $(1, p, q, pq)$.  
- In both cases, the number of divisors is 4.  
- The question asks: “How many positive integers divide $(n)$?” → Answer is 4.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Combining  
- Each statement alone already determines the answer (4 divisors).  
- So combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(D)** — Each statement alone is sufficient.  

---

## Q13

### Statement (1)  
- The average of $(x, y, z)$ is 6.  
- So $(\frac{x+y+z}{3} = 6 \implies x+y+z = 18)$.  
- This relates the three variables but does not fix $(z)$.  
- **Insufficient.**

### Statement (2)  
- $(x = -y)$.  
- This gives a relationship between $(x)$ and $(y)$, but says nothing about $(z)$.  
- **Insufficient.**

### Combining (1) and (2)  
- From (2): $(x = -y)$.  
- Substitute into (1): $(x + y + z = 18 \implies (-y) + y + z = 18 \implies z = 18)$.  
- So yes, $(z = 18)$.  
- **Together, sufficient.**

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(C)** — Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient.

## Q14

### Statement (1)  
- Elena’s monthly salary = \$1,000.  
- But we don’t know her commission (depends on sales revenue).  
- **Insufficient.**

### Statement (2)  
- Commission = 5% of sales revenue.  
- But we don’t know her salary or her sales revenue.  
- **Insufficient.**

### Combining (1) and (2)  
- Salary = \$1,000.  
- Commission = 5% of sales revenue.  
- $Total = (1000 + 0.05 \times \text{sales revenue})$.  
- Without knowing sales revenue, we cannot calculate the total.  
- **Still insufficient.**

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(E)** — Statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient.
