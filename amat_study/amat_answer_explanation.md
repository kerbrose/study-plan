## Q1

### Problem Restatement
We want to determine if $(zw > 0)$.  
We are given two statements:

1. $(z + w^3 = 20)$  
2. $(z > 0)$

---

### Step 1: Consider Statement (1) Alone
From (1):  
$[
z = 20 - w^3
]$

This equation links $(z)$ and $(w)$, but it doesn’t tell us the sign of either variable individually.  
- If $(w = 2)$, then $(z = 20 - 8 = 12)$, so $(zw = 24 > 0)$.  
- If $(w = -2)$, then $(z = 20 - (-8) = 28)$, so $(zw = -56 < 0)$.  

Thus, **Statement (1) alone is insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Consider Statement (2) Alone
Statement (2) says $(z > 0)$.  
But we know nothing about $(w)$.  
- If $(w > 0)$, then $(zw > 0)$.  
- If $(w < 0)$, then $(zw < 0)$.  

So **Statement (2) alone is insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
From (1): $(z = 20 - w^3)$.  
From (2): $(z > 0)$.  

So:
$[
20 - w^3 > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad w^3 < 20
]$

This means $(w < \sqrt[3]{20} \approx 2.71)$.  
But $(w)$ could still be positive or negative.  
- If $(w = 2)$, then $(z = 12)$, so $(zw = 24 > 0)$.  
- If $(w = -2)$, then $(z = 28)$, so $(zw = -56 < 0)$.  

Even with both statements, we cannot determine the sign of $(zw)$.

---

### Final Answer
The information given is **insufficient** to determine whether $(zw)$ is positive.

## Q2


### Problem Restatement
We know the ratio of Brand Y to Brand X computers is $(5:6)$.  
We want to find the **number of Brand Y computers**.

---

### Step 1: Express the Ratio
Let:
- Brand Y computers = $(5k)$  
- Brand X computers = $(6k)$  

for some positive integer $(k)$.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (1)
Statement (1): Brand X computers exceed Brand Y computers by 80.  
$[
6k - 5k = 80 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 80
]$  
So Brand Y computers = $(5k = 400)$.  

✅ Statement (1) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Analyze Statement (2)
Statement (2): Total computers = 880.  
$[
5k + 6k = 11k = 880 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 80
]$  
So Brand Y computers = $(5k = 400)$.  

✅ Statement (2) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 4: Combine Statements
Since each statement alone is sufficient, combining them is unnecessary.

---

### Final Answer
Each statement alone is sufficient.  
Correct choice: **D** (Each statement alone is sufficient).
