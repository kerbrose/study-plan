## Q1

### Problem Restatement
We want to determine if $(zw > 0)$.  
We are given two statements:

1. $(z + w^3 = 20)$  
2. $(z > 0)$

---

### Step 1: Consider Statement (1) Alone
From (1):  
$[
z = 20 - w^3
]$

This equation links $(z)$ and $(w)$, but it doesn’t tell us the sign of either variable individually.  
- If $(w = 2)$, then $(z = 20 - 8 = 12)$, so $(zw = 24 > 0)$.  
- If $(w = -2)$, then $(z = 20 - (-8) = 28)$, so $(zw = -56 < 0)$.  

Thus, **Statement (1) alone is insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Consider Statement (2) Alone
Statement (2) says $(z > 0)$.  
But we know nothing about $(w)$.  
- If $(w > 0)$, then $(zw > 0)$.  
- If $(w < 0)$, then $(zw < 0)$.  

So **Statement (2) alone is insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
From (1): $(z = 20 - w^3)$.  
From (2): $(z > 0)$.  

So:
$[
20 - w^3 > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad w^3 < 20
]$

This means $(w < \sqrt[3]{20} \approx 2.71)$.  
But $(w)$ could still be positive or negative.  
- If $(w = 2)$, then $(z = 12)$, so $(zw = 24 > 0)$.  
- If $(w = -2)$, then $(z = 28)$, so $(zw = -56 < 0)$.  

Even with both statements, we cannot determine the sign of $(zw)$.

---

### Final Answer
The information given is **insufficient** to determine whether $(zw)$ is positive.

## Q2


### Problem Restatement
We know the ratio of Brand Y to Brand X computers is $(5:6)$.  
We want to find the **number of Brand Y computers**.

---

### Step 1: Express the Ratio
Let:
- Brand Y computers = $(5k)$  
- Brand X computers = $(6k)$  

for some positive integer $(k)$.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (1)
Statement (1): Brand X computers exceed Brand Y computers by 80.  
$[
6k - 5k = 80 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 80
]$  
So Brand Y computers = $(5k = 400)$.  

✅ Statement (1) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Analyze Statement (2)
Statement (2): Total computers = 880.  
$[
5k + 6k = 11k = 880 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 80
]$  
So Brand Y computers = $(5k = 400)$.  

✅ Statement (2) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 4: Combine Statements
Since each statement alone is sufficient, combining them is unnecessary.

---

### Final Answer
Each statement alone is sufficient.  
Correct choice: **D** (Each statement alone is sufficient).

## Q3


### Problem Restatement
Ann saves $(x)$ dollars per week, Beth saves $(y)$ dollars per week.  
We want the **total amount saved per week**:  
$[
x + y
]$

---

### Step 1: Analyze Statement (1)
Beth saves $5 more than Ann:  
$[
y = x + 5
]$

So total savings:  
$[
x + y = x + (x+5) = 2x + 5
]$

We don’t know $(x)$.  
❌ Statement (1) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (2)
Ann saves in 6 weeks what Beth saves in 5 weeks:  
$[
6x = 5y \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \tfrac{6}{5}x
]$

So total savings:  
$[
x + y = x + \tfrac{6}{5}x = \tfrac{11}{5}x
]$

We don’t know $(x)$.  
❌ Statement (2) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
From (1): $(y = x + 5)$.  
From (2): $(y = \tfrac{6}{5}x)$.  

Set equal:  
$[
x + 5 = \tfrac{6}{5}x
]$

Multiply through:  
$[
5x + 25 = 6x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 25
]$

Then:  
$[
y = x + 5 = 30
]$

So total savings:  
$[
x + y = 25 + 30 = 55
]$

✅ Together, the statements are **sufficient**.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **C** (Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient).

---



## Q4

### Problem Restatement
We know:
$[
\text{Total price of } n \text{ shares} = 12{,}000
]$
So:
$[
\text{Price per share} = \frac{12{,}000}{n}
]$

We want the price per share.

---

### Step 1: Analyze Statement (1)
If the price per share had been $1 more, the total price would have been $300 more.

Let price per share = $(p)$.  
So:
$[
n \cdot (p+1) = 12{,}000 + 300 = 12{,}300
]$

But we also know:
$[
n \cdot p = 12{,}000
]$

Subtract:
$[
n(p+1) - np = 12{,}300 - 12{,}000
]$
$[
n = 300
]$

So:
$[
p = \frac{12{,}000}{300} = 40
]$

✅ Statement (1) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (2)
If the price per share had been $2 less, the total price would have been 5% less.

So:
$[
n(p-2) = 0.95 \cdot 12{,}000 = 11{,}400
]$

But we also know:
$[
np = 12{,}000
]$

Subtract:
$[
np - n(p-2) = 12{,}000 - 11{,}400
]$
$[
2n = 600 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = 300
]$

So:
$[
p = \frac{12{,}000}{300} = 40
]$

✅ Statement (2) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements
Each statement alone already gives the answer, so combining is unnecessary.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **D** (Each statement alone is sufficient).

---


## Q5

### Problem Restatement
Total cost of the dinner = ?  
It was shared equally by $(k)$ of the $(n)$ employees.  
We want the **total cost**.

---

### Step 1: Analyze Statement (1)
Each of the $(k)$ employees paid $19.  
So:

$[
\text{Total cost} = 19k
]$

But we don’t know \(k\).  
❌ Statement (1) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (2)
If the cost had been shared by $(k+1)$ employees, each would have paid $18.  
So:

$[
\text{Total cost} = 18(k+1)
]$

But we don’t know \(k\).  
❌ Statement (2) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
From (1):  
$[
\text{Total cost} = 19k
]$

From (2):  
$[
\text{Total cost} = 18(k+1)
]$

Set equal:  
$[
19k = 18(k+1)
]$
$[
19k = 18k + 18
]$
$[
k = 18
]$

So:  
$[
\text{Total cost} = 19k = 19 \cdot 18 = 342
]$

✅ Together, the statements are **sufficient**.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **C** (Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient).

---


Q6

### Problem Restatement
We want the value of $(y)$, given that $(x)$ and $(y)$ are integers.

---

### Step 1: Statement (1) Alone
$[
xy = 27
]$

Possible integer factor pairs of 27:  
$((x,y) = (1,27), (27,1), (3,9), (9,3), (-1,-27), (-27,-1), (-3,-9), (-9,-3))$.

So $(y)$ could be many values.  
❌ Statement (1) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Statement (2) Alone
$[
x = y^2
]$

This only relates $(x)$ and $(y)$. But without more information, $(y)$ could be many integers (positive or negative).  
❌ Statement (2) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
From (2): $(x = y^2)$.  
Plug into (1):  
$[
y^2 \cdot y = 27 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y^3 = 27
]$

So:  
$[
y = 3
]$

✅ Together, the statements are **sufficient**.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **C** (Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient).
