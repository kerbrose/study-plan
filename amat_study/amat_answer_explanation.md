## Q1

### Problem Restatement
We want to determine if $(zw > 0)$.  
We are given two statements:

1. $(z + w^3 = 20)$  
2. $(z > 0)$

---

### Step 1: Consider Statement (1) Alone
From (1):  
$[
z = 20 - w^3
]$

This equation links $(z)$ and $(w)$, but it doesn’t tell us the sign of either variable individually.  
- If $(w = 2)$, then $(z = 20 - 8 = 12)$, so $(zw = 24 > 0)$.  
- If $(w = -2)$, then $(z = 20 - (-8) = 28)$, so $(zw = -56 < 0)$.  

Thus, **Statement (1) alone is insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Consider Statement (2) Alone
Statement (2) says $(z > 0)$.  
But we know nothing about $(w)$.  
- If $(w > 0)$, then $(zw > 0)$.  
- If $(w < 0)$, then $(zw < 0)$.  

So **Statement (2) alone is insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
From (1): $(z = 20 - w^3)$.  
From (2): $(z > 0)$.  

So:
$[
20 - w^3 > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad w^3 < 20
]$

This means $(w < \sqrt[3]{20} \approx 2.71)$.  
But $(w)$ could still be positive or negative.  
- If $(w = 2)$, then $(z = 12)$, so $(zw = 24 > 0)$.  
- If $(w = -2)$, then $(z = 28)$, so $(zw = -56 < 0)$.  

Even with both statements, we cannot determine the sign of $(zw)$.

---

### Final Answer
The information given is **insufficient** to determine whether $(zw)$ is positive.  

---

## Q2


### Problem Restatement
We know the ratio of Brand Y to Brand X computers is $(5:6)$.  
We want to find the **number of Brand Y computers**.

---

### Step 1: Express the Ratio
Let:
- Brand Y computers = $(5k)$  
- Brand X computers = $(6k)$  

for some positive integer $(k)$.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (1)
Statement (1): Brand X computers exceed Brand Y computers by 80.  
$[
6k - 5k = 80 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 80
]$  
So Brand Y computers = $(5k = 400)$.  

✅ Statement (1) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Analyze Statement (2)
Statement (2): Total computers = 880.  
$[
5k + 6k = 11k = 880 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 80
]$  
So Brand Y computers = $(5k = 400)$.  

✅ Statement (2) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 4: Combine Statements
Since each statement alone is sufficient, combining them is unnecessary.

---

### Final Answer
Each statement alone is sufficient.  
Correct choice: **D** (Each statement alone is sufficient).

---


## Q3


### Problem Restatement
Ann saves $(x)$ dollars per week, Beth saves $(y)$ dollars per week.  
We want the **total amount saved per week**:  
$[
x + y
]$

---

### Step 1: Analyze Statement (1)
Beth saves $5 more than Ann:  
$[
y = x + 5
]$

So total savings:  
$[
x + y = x + (x+5) = 2x + 5
]$

We don’t know $(x)$.  
❌ Statement (1) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (2)
Ann saves in 6 weeks what Beth saves in 5 weeks:  
$[
6x = 5y \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \tfrac{6}{5}x
]$

So total savings:  
$[
x + y = x + \tfrac{6}{5}x = \tfrac{11}{5}x
]$

We don’t know $(x)$.  
❌ Statement (2) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
From (1): $(y = x + 5)$.  
From (2): $(y = \tfrac{6}{5}x)$.  

Set equal:  
$[
x + 5 = \tfrac{6}{5}x
]$

Multiply through:  
$[
5x + 25 = 6x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 25
]$

Then:  
$[
y = x + 5 = 30
]$

So total savings:  
$[
x + y = 25 + 30 = 55
]$

✅ Together, the statements are **sufficient**.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **C** (Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient).

---



## Q4

### Problem Restatement
We know:
$[
\text{Total price of } n \text{ shares} = 12{,}000
]$
So:
$[
\text{Price per share} = \frac{12{,}000}{n}
]$

We want the price per share.

---

### Step 1: Analyze Statement (1)
If the price per share had been $1 more, the total price would have been $300 more.

Let price per share = $(p)$.  
So:
$[
n \cdot (p+1) = 12{,}000 + 300 = 12{,}300
]$

But we also know:
$[
n \cdot p = 12{,}000
]$

Subtract:
$[
n(p+1) - np = 12{,}300 - 12{,}000
]$
$[
n = 300
]$

So:
$[
p = \frac{12{,}000}{300} = 40
]$

✅ Statement (1) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (2)
If the price per share had been $2 less, the total price would have been 5% less.

So:
$[
n(p-2) = 0.95 \cdot 12{,}000 = 11{,}400
]$

But we also know:
$[
np = 12{,}000
]$

Subtract:
$[
np - n(p-2) = 12{,}000 - 11{,}400
]$
$[
2n = 600 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = 300
]$

So:
$[
p = \frac{12{,}000}{300} = 40
]$

✅ Statement (2) alone is **sufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements
Each statement alone already gives the answer, so combining is unnecessary.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **D** (Each statement alone is sufficient).

---


## Q5

### Problem Restatement
Total cost of the dinner = ?  
It was shared equally by $(k)$ of the $(n)$ employees.  
We want the **total cost**.

---

### Step 1: Analyze Statement (1)
Each of the $(k)$ employees paid $19.  
So:

$[
\text{Total cost} = 19k
]$

But we don’t know $k$.  
❌ Statement (1) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (2)
If the cost had been shared by $(k+1)$ employees, each would have paid $18.  
So:

$[
\text{Total cost} = 18(k+1)
]$

But we don’t know $k$.  
❌ Statement (2) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
From (1):  
$[
\text{Total cost} = 19k
]$

From (2):  
$[
\text{Total cost} = 18(k+1)
]$

Set equal:  
$[
19k = 18(k+1)
]$
$[
19k = 18k + 18
]$
$[
k = 18
]$

So:  
$[
\text{Total cost} = 19k = 19 \cdot 18 = 342
]$

✅ Together, the statements are **sufficient**.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **C** (Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient).

---


Q6

### Problem Restatement
We want the value of $(y)$, given that $(x)$ and $(y)$ are integers.

---

### Step 1: Statement (1) Alone
$[
xy = 27
]$

Possible integer factor pairs of 27:  
$((x,y) = (1,27), (27,1), (3,9), (9,3), (-1,-27), (-27,-1), (-3,-9), (-9,-3))$.

So $(y)$ could be many values.  
❌ Statement (1) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Statement (2) Alone
$[
x = y^2
]$

This only relates $(x)$ and $(y)$. But without more information, $(y)$ could be many integers (positive or negative).  
❌ Statement (2) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
From (2): $(x = y^2)$.  
Plug into (1):  
$[
y^2 \cdot y = 27 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y^3 = 27
]$

So:  
$[
y = 3
]$

✅ Together, the statements are **sufficient**.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **C** (Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient).

---


## Q7

### Problem Restatement
We want the average of $(x)$ and $(y)$:  
$[
\frac{x+y}{2}
]$

---

### Step 1: Statement (1) Alone
The average of $(x)$ and $(2y)$ is 10:  
$[
\frac{x + 2y}{2} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x + 2y = 20
]$

This is one equation with two unknowns.  
We cannot determine $(\frac{x+y}{2})$ uniquely.  
❌ Statement (1) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 2: Statement (2) Alone
The average of $(2x)$ and $(7y)$ is 32:  
$[
\frac{2x + 7y}{2} = 32 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2x + 7y = 64
]$

This is also one equation with two unknowns.  
We cannot determine $(\frac{x+y}{2})$ uniquely.  
❌ Statement (2) alone is **insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
We now have a system of equations:

1. $(x + 2y = 20)$  
2. $(2x + 7y = 64)$

Solve (1) for $(x)$:  
$[
x = 20 - 2y
]$

Substitute into (2):  
$[
2(20 - 2y) + 7y = 64
]$  
$[
40 - 4y + 7y = 64
]$  
$[
3y = 24 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 8
]$

Then:  
$[
x = 20 - 2(8) = 4
]$

So:  
$[
\frac{x+y}{2} = \frac{4+8}{2} = 6
]$

✅ Together, the statements are **sufficient**.

---

### Final Answer
Correct choice: **C** (Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient).

---


## Q8


### Statement (1)
- 40% of the total donations came from corporate sources.
- This tells us the proportion but not the actual amount.  
- Alone, it’s insufficient.

### Statement (2)
- $1.5 million came from noncorporate donations.
- This gives us a dollar amount, but not the total.  
- Alone, it’s insufficient.

### Combining (1) and (2)
- If 40% came from corporate donations, then 60% came from noncorporate donations.
- Statement (2) says noncorporate donations = $1.5 million.
- So, 60% of the total = $1.5 million.
- Total donations = $(\frac{1.5}{0.6} = 2.5)$ million.

✅ Together, the statements are sufficient to determine the total amount donated: **$2.5 million**.

---

## Q9


### Statement (1)
- Rule: After the first two terms, each term = average of the last two preceding terms.  
- This defines the recurrence relation, but without knowing the actual values of the first two terms, we cannot compute the sequence.  
- **Insufficient alone.**

### Statement (2)
- The average of the first three terms = 10.  
- So $((a_1 + a_2 + a_3)/3 = 10 \implies a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 30)$.  
- But we don’t know how the terms are related, so we cannot determine the fourth term.  
- **Insufficient alone.**

### Combining (1) and (2)
- From (1): $(a_3 = (a_1 + a_2)/2)$.  
- Plug into (2): $(a_1 + a_2 + (a_1 + a_2)/2 = 30)$.  
- That simplifies to $(1.5(a_1 + a_2) = 30 \implies a_1 + a_2 = 20)$.  
- Then $(a_3 = 10)$.  
- From (1): (a_4 = (a_2 + a_3)/2 = (a_2 + 10)/2)$.  

Now the sum of the first four terms:  
$[
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 20 + 10 + \frac{a_2 + 10}{2} = 30 + \frac{a_2 + 10}{2}
]$

This still depends on $(a_2)$. Without knowing $(a_2)$ individually, we cannot fix the sum.  

### Conclusion
Even together, the statements are **not sufficient** to determine the sum of the first four terms.  

---

## Q10

### Statement (1)
- $(101 < N < 103)$.  
- Since $(N)$ is an integer, the only possible value is $(N = 102)$.  
- **Sufficient.**

### Statement (2)
- $(202 < 2N < 206)$.  
- Divide through by 2: $(101 < N < 103)$.  
- Again, the only integer value is $(N = 102)$.  
- **Sufficient.**

### Combining
- Each statement alone already determines $(N = 102)$.  
- So combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:
**(D)** — Each statement alone is sufficient.  

---

## Q11

### Statement (1): $(a < c < e)$  
- This only gives us a partial ordering among three of the numbers.  
- We don’t know where $(b)$ and $(d)$ fit relative to them.  
- So we cannot determine whether $(d)$ is the median.  
- **Insufficient.**

### Statement (2): $(b < d < c)$  
- This gives us a partial ordering among three numbers.  
- But again, we don’t know where $(a)$ and $(e)$ fit.  
- So we cannot determine whether $(d)$ is the median.  
- **Insufficient.**

### Combining (1) and (2)  
- From (1): $(a < c < e)$.  
- From (2): $(b < d < c)$.  
- Together we know: $(a < c < e)$ and $(b < d < c)$.  
- So the combined order is: $(a, b, d, c, e)$ (with some flexibility between $(a)$ and $(b)$, since we don’t know which is smaller).  

Now, the median of five numbers is the third number when arranged in ascending order.  
- If $(a < b)$, the order is $(a, b, d, c, e)$. Median = $(d)$.  
- If $(b < a)$, the order is $(b, a, d, c, e)$. Median = $(d)$.  

In both cases, the median is indeed $(d)$.  
- **Together, sufficient.**

---

### Correct Answer Choice:
**(C)** — Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient.  

---

## Q12



### Statement (1)  
- $(n)$ is the product of two different prime numbers.  
- So $(n = p \cdot q)$, where $(p)$ and $(q)$ are distinct primes.  
- The number of positive divisors of $(n)$ is $((1+1)(1+1) = 4)$.  
- Divisors are: $(1, p, q, pq)$.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2)  
- $(n)$ and $(2^3 = 8)$ are each divisible by the same number of positive integers.  
- The number of divisors of 8 is 4 (since $(8 = 2^3)$, divisors count = $(3+1 = 4)$).  
- So $(n)$ also has 4 divisors.  
- The only integers with exactly 4 divisors are:  
  - The cube of a prime $(p^3)$, divisors: $(1, p, p^2, p^3)$.  
  - The product of two distinct primes $(p \cdot q)$, divisors: $(1, p, q, pq)$.  
- In both cases, the number of divisors is 4.  
- The question asks: “How many positive integers divide $(n)$?” → Answer is 4.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Combining  
- Each statement alone already determines the answer (4 divisors).  
- So combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(D)** — Each statement alone is sufficient.  

---

## Q13

### Statement (1)  
- The average of $(x, y, z)$ is 6.  
- So $(\frac{x+y+z}{3} = 6 \implies x+y+z = 18)$.  
- This relates the three variables but does not fix $(z)$.  
- **Insufficient.**

### Statement (2)  
- $(x = -y)$.  
- This gives a relationship between $(x)$ and $(y)$, but says nothing about $(z)$.  
- **Insufficient.**

### Combining (1) and (2)  
- From (2): $(x = -y)$.  
- Substitute into (1): $(x + y + z = 18 \implies (-y) + y + z = 18 \implies z = 18)$.  
- So yes, $(z = 18)$.  
- **Together, sufficient.**

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(C)** — Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient.  

---

## Q14

### Statement (1)  
- Elena’s monthly salary = \$1,000.  
- But we don’t know her commission (depends on sales revenue).  
- **Insufficient.**

### Statement (2)  
- Commission = 5% of sales revenue.  
- But we don’t know her salary or her sales revenue.  
- **Insufficient.**

### Combining (1) and (2)  
- Salary = \$1,000.  
- Commission = 5% of sales revenue.  
- $Total = (1000 + 0.05 \times \text{sales revenue})$.  
- Without knowing sales revenue, we cannot calculate the total.  
- **Still insufficient.**

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(E)** — Statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient.  

---


## Q15

---

### Statement (1)  
- $(S)$ consists of five consecutive integers.  
- We’re told 11 is in $(S)$, but 10 is not.  
- That means the set must be $(11, 12, 13, 14, 15)$.  
- Sum = $(11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 = 65)$.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2)  
- The sum of the even integers in $(S)$ is 26.  
- In any set of five consecutive integers, there are either 2 or 3 even numbers.  
- Let’s test:  
  - If the set is $(9, 10, 11, 12, 13)$, evens = $(10 + 12 = 22)$. Not 26.  
  - If the set is $(10, 11, 12, 13, 14)$, evens = $(10 + 12 + 14 = 36)$. Not 26.  
  - If the set is $(11, 12, 13, 14, 15)$, evens = $(12 + 14 = 26)$. Matches.  
- So the set must be $(11, 12, 13, 14, 15)$.  
- Sum = 65.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Combining  
- Each statement alone already determines the sum.  
- So combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(D)** — Each statement alone is sufficient.  

---

## Q16


### Statement (1)  
- The volume of cube $(A)$ is 160% of the volume of cube $(B)$.  
- That means $(V_A = 1.6 \cdot V_B)$.  
- Clearly, $(V_A > V_B)$.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2)  
- The volume of cube $(B)$ is 62.5% of the volume of cube $(A)$.  
- That means $(V_B = 0.625 \cdot V_A)$.  
- Equivalently, $(V_A = 1.6 \cdot V_B)$.  
- Again, $(V_A > V_B)$.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Combining  
- Each statement alone already determines that cube $(A)$’s volume is greater.  
- So combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(D)** — Each statement alone is sufficient.  

---

## Q17


We’re asked: **What is the value of $(m)$ if $(m = \frac{4c}{5d})$ and $(d \neq 0)$?**

---

### Statement (1): $c = 10d$  
- Substitute into $(m = \frac{4c}{5d})$:  
  $[m = \frac{4(10d)}{5d} = \frac{40d}{5d} = 8]$  
- This gives a unique value for $(m)$.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): $(c = 2)$  
- Substitute into $(m = \frac{4c}{5d})$:  
$[m = \frac{4(2)}{5d} = \frac{8}{5d}]$  
- Since $(d)$ is not specified (only that $d \neq 0$), $(m)$ cannot be uniquely determined.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combining (1) and (2)  
- From (2): $(c = 2)$.  
- From (1): $(c = 10d)$.  
- So $(10d = 2 \implies d = 0.2)$.  
- But the problem specifies $(d)$ is an integer (since $(n)$ and divisibility context earlier implied integer treatment). If we assume $(d)$ must be an integer, this is a contradiction.  
- If $(d)$ is allowed to be non-integer, then $(d = 0.2)$ works, and $(m = \frac{4(2)}{5(0.2)} = \frac{8}{1} = 8)$.  
- Either way, the two statements together force $(m = 8)$.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(A)** — Statement (1) alone is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not.  

---


## Q18

We want: **the value of $(2x - y)$.**

---

### Statement (1): $(x + y = 12)$  
- This gives a relationship between $(x)$ and $(y)$.  
- But we cannot directly determine $(2x - y)$.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): $(x - y = 4)$  
- This gives another relationship between $(x)$ and $(y)$.  
- But again, not enough to determine $(2x - y)$.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combining (1) and (2)  
We have the system:  
$[x + y = 12 \quad (1)]$  
$[x - y = 4 \quad (2)]$

Add them:  
$[2x = 16 \implies x = 8]$  
Substitute into (1):  
$[8 + y = 12 \implies y = 4]$

Now compute:  
$[2x - y = 2(8) - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12]$

So the value is uniquely determined: $(2x - y = 12)$.  
- **Together, sufficient.**

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(C)** — Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient.  

---


## Q19


We want: **the ratio of $(c)$ to $(d)$.**

---

### Statement (1)  
- The ratio of $(3c)$ to $(3d)$ is $(3:4)$.  
- That means $(\frac{3c}{3d} = \frac{3}{4} \implies \frac{c}{d} = \frac{3}{4})$.  
- So the ratio of $(c)$ to $(d)$ is uniquely determined.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2)  
- The ratio of $(c+3)$ to $(d+3)$ is $(4:5)$.  
- So $(\frac{c+3}{d+3} = \frac{4}{5})$.  
- Cross multiply: $(5(c+3) = 4(d+3))$.  
- Simplify: $(5c + 15 = 4d + 12 \implies 5c = 4d - 3)$.  
- This gives a linear relationship between $(c)$ and $(d)$, but not a fixed ratio.  
- For example, if $(d=3)$, then $(c=1)$ → ratio $(1:3)$. If $(d=7)$, then $(c=5)$ → ratio $(5:7)$.  
- Different possible ratios.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combining  
- Statement (1) alone already determines the ratio uniquely $(3:4)$.  
- Statement (2) is not needed.  

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(A)** — Statement (1) alone is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not.  

---

## Q20

We want the value of $x$.

---

### Statement (1): $x + 1 = 2 - 3x$  
$x + 1 = 2 - 3x \implies 4x = 1 \implies x = \tfrac{1}{4}$  
This gives a unique value for $x$.  
**Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): $\frac{1}{2x} = 2$  
$\frac{1}{2x} = 2 \implies 1 = 4x \implies x = \tfrac{1}{4}$  
Again, this gives a unique value for $x$.  
**Sufficient.**

---

### Combining  
Each statement alone already determines $x = \tfrac{1}{4}$.  
So combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(D)** — Each statement alone is sufficient.  

---

## Q21
We’re asked: **Which of the positive numbers $x$ or $y$ is greater?**

---

### Statement (1): $y = 2x$  
- Since both are positive, $y$ is always twice $x$.  
- That means $y > x$.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): $2x + 5y = 12$  
- This is one equation with two unknowns.  
- For example:  
  - If $x=1, y=2$, then $2(1)+5(2)=12$. Here $y > x$.  
  - If $x=2.5, y=1.5$, then $2(2.5)+5(1.5)=12$. Here $x > y$.  
- So depending on the values, either $x$ or $y$ could be greater.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combining  
- Statement (1) alone already determines that $y > x$.  
- Statement (2) is not needed.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(A)** — Statement (1) alone is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not.  

---


## Q22

We’re asked: **What is the value of $2^*$ if $x^* = ax + a$, where $a$ is a constant?**

---

### Statement (1): $3^* = 2$  
By definition:  
$3^* = a(3) + a = 3a + a = 4a$  
So $4a = 2 \implies a = \tfrac{1}{2}$.  
Now compute:  
$2^* = a(2) + a = 2a + a = 3a = 3 \cdot \tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{3}{2}$  
Unique value found.  
**Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): $5^* = 3$  
By definition:  
$5^* = a(5) + a = 5a + a = 6a$  
So $6a = 3 \implies a = \tfrac{1}{2}$.  
Now compute:  
$2^* = 2a + a = 3a = 3 \cdot \tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{3}{2}$  
Unique value found.  
**Sufficient.**

---

### Combining  
Each statement alone already determines $2^* = \tfrac{3}{2}$.  
So combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(D)** — Each statement alone is sufficient.  

---

## Q23

We want: **the value of $(x-y)^2$ given $x^2 + y^2 = 29$.**

---

### Statement (1): $xy = 10$  
We know:  
$(x-y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy$  
Substitute:  
$(x-y)^2 = 29 - 2(10) = 29 - 20 = 9$  
So $(x-y)^2 = 9$.  
**Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): $x = 5$  
Substitute into $x^2 + y^2 = 29$:  
$25 + y^2 = 29 \implies y^2 = 4 \implies y = \pm 2$  
Now compute:  
- If $y = 2$: $(x-y)^2 = (5-2)^2 = 9$.  
- If $y = -2$: $(x-y)^2 = (5 - (-2))^2 = (7)^2 = 49$.  
Two possible values.  
**Insufficient.**

---

### Combining  
Statement (1) alone already gives a unique value.  
Statement (2) alone does not.  
So combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(A)** — Statement (1) alone is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not.  

---


## Q24

We’re asked: **Is $2x > 2y$?**

---

### Statement (1): $x > y$  
- If $x > y$, then multiplying both sides by 2 (positive constant) gives $2x > 2y$.  
- So the answer is **Yes**.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): $3x > 3y$  
- Divide both sides by 3 (positive constant): $x > y$.  
- Same reasoning as above: $2x > 2y$.  
- So the answer is **Yes**.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Combining  
- Each statement alone already determines the answer.  
- Combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(D)** — Each statement alone is sufficient.  

---


# Q25

We’re asked: **What is their combined monthly salary?**

---

### Statement (1): Rita’s monthly salary = \$4,000  
- Given: Rita’s salary = $\tfrac{2}{3}$ Juanita’s salary.  
- So Juanita’s salary = $\tfrac{3}{2} \times 4000 = 6000$.  
- Combined = $4000 + 6000 = 10{,}000$.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): Either Rita’s salary or Juanita’s salary = \$6,000  
- Case 1: Rita = 6000. Then Juanita = $\tfrac{3}{2} \times 6000 = 9000$. Combined = 15,000.  
- Case 2: Juanita = 6000. Then Rita = $\tfrac{2}{3} \times 6000 = 4000$. Combined = 10,000.  
- Two possible totals (10,000 or 15,000).  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combining  
- Statement (1) alone already gives the answer (10,000).  
- Statement (2) alone does not.  
- So combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(A)** — Statement (1) alone is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not.  

---

## Q26

We’re asked: **How many cars are to be sold?**

---

### Statement (1)  
- Suppose there are $C$ cars and $S$ salespeople.  
- Each salesperson sells 4 cars → total sold = $4S$.  
- Remaining unsold = 23.  
- So:  
$C - 4S = 23 \quad \implies \quad C = 4S + 23$  
- Two unknowns, one equation. Cannot determine $C$.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Statement (2)  
- Each salesperson sells 6 cars → total sold = $6S$.  
- Remaining unsold = 5.  
- So:  
$C - 6S = 5 \quad \implies \quad C = 6S + 5$  
- Again, two unknowns, one equation. Cannot determine $C$.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combining (1) and (2)  
We have:  
$C = 4S + 23 \quad (1)$  
$C = 6S + 5 \quad (2)$

Set equal:  
$4S + 23 = 6S + 5 \implies 2S = 18 \implies S = 9$  
Substitute back:  
$C = 4(9) + 23 = 36 + 23 = 59$  

So the dealership has **59 cars**.  
- **Together, sufficient.**

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(C)** — Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient.  

---

## Q27

We’re asked: **If $x$ is a positive integer, what is the value of $x$?**

---

### Statement (1): $x^2 = \sqrt{x}$  
- Rewrite: $x^2 = x^{1/2}$.  
- So $x^{3/2} = 1 \implies x^{3} = 1$.  
- Thus $x = 1$.  
- Since $x$ is a positive integer, the only solution is $x=1$.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): $\frac{n}{x} = n$ and $n \neq 0$  
- Divide both sides by $n$: $\frac{1}{x} = 1$.  
- So $x = 1$.  
- Unique value.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Combining  
- Each statement alone already determines $x = 1$.  
- So combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(D)** — Each statement alone is sufficient.  

---


## Q28

We’re asked: **How many hours would it take Pump A and Pump B working together to empty the tank?**

---

### Statement (1)  
- Pump A alone empties the tank in 4 hours 20 minutes.  
- Convert: $4 \text{ hours } 20 \text{ minutes} = 4 + \tfrac{20}{60} = 4 + \tfrac{1}{3} = \tfrac{13}{3}$ hours.  
- So Pump A’s rate = $\tfrac{1}{13/3} = \tfrac{3}{13}$ tanks per hour.  
- We know Pump A’s rate, but not Pump B’s.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Statement (2)  
- Pump B empties the tank at 72 liters per minute.  
- But we don’t know the total capacity of the tank, so we cannot convert this into “tanks per hour.”  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combining (1) and (2)  
- Pump A’s rate = $\tfrac{3}{13}$ tanks/hour.  
- Pump B’s rate = $\tfrac{72}{60} = 1.2$ liters/second? Careful—let’s standardize.  
  - Pump B = 72 liters/minute = $72 \times 60 = 4320$ liters/hour.  
- But we don’t know the tank’s total volume in liters.  
- Without the tank capacity, we cannot express Pump B’s rate in “tanks per hour.”  
- Therefore, we cannot combine the two rates to find the joint time.  
- **Still insufficient.**

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(E)** — Statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient.  

---

## Q29

We’re asked: **What is the area of rectangular region $R$?**

---

### Statement (1): Each diagonal of $R$ has length 5  
- Let the sides be $a$ and $b$.  
- Diagonal length: $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 5 \implies a^2 + b^2 = 25$.  
- This gives a relationship but not the product $ab$ (which is the area).  
- For example: $a=3, b=4 \implies \text{area}=12$. Or $a=1, b=\sqrt{24} \implies \text{area} \approx 4.9$.  
- Multiple possible areas.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): The perimeter of $R$ is 14  
- Perimeter: $2(a+b) = 14 \implies a+b = 7$.  
- Again, this gives a relationship but not the product $ab$.  
- For example: $a=3, b=4 \implies \text{area}=12$. Or $a=2, b=5 \implies \text{area}=10$.  
- Multiple possible areas.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combining (1) and (2)  
We have:  
$a^2 + b^2 = 25 \quad \text{and} \quad a+b = 7$

Square the sum:  
$(a+b)^2 = 49 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab$  
Substitute:  
$49 = 25 + 2ab \implies 2ab = 24 \implies ab = 12$

So the area of $R$ is **12**.  
- **Together, sufficient.**

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(C)** — Both statements together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient.  

---


## Q30

We’re asked: **Did the tank contain more than 30 gallons of water when it started to leak?**  
(Remember: $1 \text{ gallon} = 128 \text{ ounces}$. So 30 gallons = $30 \times 128 = 3840$ ounces.)

---

### Statement (1): Leak rate = 6.4 ounces/minute  
- This gives the rate, but not the total time until empty.  
- Without knowing how long it leaked, we cannot determine the initial volume.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): Tank became empty in less than 12 hours  
- This gives a maximum time, but no leak rate.  
- Without the leak rate, we cannot determine the initial volume.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combining (1) and (2)  
- Leak rate = 6.4 ounces/minute.  
- Time < 12 hours = $12 \times 60 = 720$ minutes.  
- Maximum leaked volume = $6.4 \times 720 = 4608$ ounces.  
- So the initial volume < 4608 ounces.  
- Compare with 30 gallons = 3840 ounces:  
  - The tank could have contained **less than 30 gallons** (e.g., 3000 ounces).  
  - Or **more than 30 gallons** (e.g., 4000 ounces, still < 4608).  
- Both possibilities exist.  
- **Still insufficient.**

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(E)** — Statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient.  

---


## Q31

We’re asked: **Was Sherry’s average speed faster than 24 km/h?**

---

### Step 1: Convert 24 km/h into meters per second  
$24 \text{ km/h} = \frac{24{,}000 \text{ m}}{3600 \text{ s}} = \frac{24{,}000}{3600} = 6.\overline{6} \text{ m/s}$  
So the threshold is about **6.67 m/s**.

---

### Statement (1): Sherry’s average speed > 7 m/s  
- Since 7 m/s > 6.67 m/s, her speed was faster than 24 km/h.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): Sherry’s average speed < 8 m/s  
- This only tells us her speed was below 8 m/s.  
- But it could be 6 m/s (slower than 24 km/h) or 7.5 m/s (faster than 24 km/h).  
- Cannot determine.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combining  
- Statement (1) alone already answers the question definitively.  
- Statement (2) alone does not.  
- Together, the answer is still determined by (1).  

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(A)** — Statement (1) alone is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not.  

---

## Q32

We’re asked: **Was Sherry’s average speed faster than 24 km/h?**

---

### Step 1: Convert 24 km/h into meters per second  
$24 \text{ km/h} = \frac{24{,}000 \text{ m}}{3600 \text{ s}} = \frac{24{,}000}{3600} = 6.\overline{6} \text{ m/s}$  
So the threshold is about **6.67 m/s**.

---

### Statement (1): Sherry’s average speed > 7 m/s  
- Since 7 m/s > 6.67 m/s, her speed was faster than 24 km/h.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): Sherry’s average speed < 8 m/s  
- This only tells us her speed was below 8 m/s.  
- But it could be 6 m/s (slower than 24 km/h) or 7.5 m/s (faster than 24 km/h).  
- Cannot determine.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combining  
- Statement (1) alone already answers the question definitively.  
- Statement (2) alone does not.  
- Together, the answer is still determined by (1).  

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(A)** — Statement (1) alone is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not.  

---

## Q33

We’re asked: **If $y = x^2 - 6x + 9$, what is the value of $x$?**

---

### Step 1: Simplify the expression  
Notice:  
$y = x^2 - 6x + 9 = (x - 3)^2$  

So $y = (x-3)^2$.

---

### Statement (1): $y = 0$  
$(x-3)^2 = 0 \implies x - 3 = 0 \implies x = 3$  
Unique solution.  
**Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): $x + y = 3$  
Substitute $y = (x-3)^2$:  
$x + (x-3)^2 = 3$  
Expand:  
$x + (x^2 - 6x + 9) = 3 \implies x^2 - 5x + 9 = 3 \implies x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$  
Factor:  
$(x-2)(x-3) = 0 \implies x = 2 \text{ or } x = 3$  
Two possible values.  
**Insufficient.**

---

### Combining  
Statement (1) alone already gives $x = 3$.  
Statement (2) alone does not.  
So combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(A)** — Statement (1) alone is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not.  

---

## Q34

To determine if  for positive  and , we can rearrange the inequality to make it easier to analyze:

By adding  to both sides, we can factor the expression:


Now we can evaluate the statements based on this simplified inequality.

---

### Statement (1): $ x < y $

This tells us the relationship between  and , but nothing about their **actual values**.

* **Case A:** If $x=0.5$ and $y=1$, then $(0.5−1)(1−1)=0$, which is which is **not** $>1$.
* **Case B:** If $x=3$ and $y=4$, then $(3−1)(4−1)=6$, which **is** $>1$.

Since we can get both a "yes" and a "no," Statement (1) is **Insufficient**.

---

### Statement (2): $2<x$

We know $x>2$. Since the original prompt states $x$ and $y$ are positive, let's look at the factored form $(x−1)(y−1)>1$ again.

    If $x=3$, the inequality becomes $2(y−1)>1$, or $y−1>0.5$, which means $y>1.5$.

    However, we don't know the value of $y$. If $y=0.1$, the inequality fails. If $y=5$, it holds.

Since we still don't know $y$, Statement (2) is **Insufficient**.

---

### Combining (1) and (2)

From (2), we know $x>2$. From (1), we know $y>x$, which implies $y>2$ as well.

If both $x>2$ and $y>2$:

    The term $(x−1)$ must be greater than 1.

    The term $(y−1)$ must be greater than 1.


The product of two numbers that are both greater than  will **always** be greater than 1. Therefore,  $(x−1)(y−1)>1$ is guaranteed to be true.

**Both statements together are Sufficient.**

---

**Correct Answer: C**

---

## Q35

We’re asked: **At what rate, in gallons per minute, is the amount of water in the tank increasing?**

---

### Statement (1):  
- The amount of water initially in the tank is 200 gallons.  
- This tells us the starting volume, but not the rates of inflow or outflow.  
- Without rates, we cannot determine the net change per minute.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Statement (2):  
- Inflow rate = 10 gallons/minute.  
- Outflow rate = 10 gallons every 2.5 minutes = $ \tfrac{10}{2.5} = 4 $ gallons/minute.  
- Net rate = $10 - 4 = 6$ gallons/minute (increasing).  
- This directly answers the question.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Combining  
- Statement (2) alone already gives the net rate.  
- Statement (1) is irrelevant for the rate question.  

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(B)** — Statement (2) alone is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not.  

---

## Q36

We’re asked: **Is $x$ a negative number?**

---

### Statement (1): $9x > 10x$  
$9x > 10x \implies -x > 0 \implies x < 0$  
So $x$ is definitely negative.  
**Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): $x + 3$ is positive  
$x + 3 > 0 \implies x > -3$  
Since $x$ could be positive (e.g., $x=5$) or negative (e.g., $x=-2$), we cannot determine whether $x$ is negative.  
**Insufficient.**

---

### Combining  
Statement (1) alone already answers the question.  
Statement (2) alone does not.  
So combining is unnecessary.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(A)** — Statement (1) alone is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not.  

---

## Q37

We want to determine if $i + j$ is an even integer.

---

### Step 1: Recall the rule
- The sum of two integers is **even** if both are even or both are odd.
- The sum is **odd** if one is even and the other is odd.

So, we need to know whether $i$ and $j$ have the same parity (both even or both odd).

---

### Step 2: Analyze Statement (1) $i < 10$
- This only tells us that $i$ is less than 10.  
- It gives no information about whether $i$ is even or odd, nor about $j$.  
- Therefore, **insufficient**.

---

### Step 3: Analyze Statement (2) $i = j$
- If $i = j$, then $i + j = 2i$.  
- $2i$ is always even, regardless of whether $i$ is odd or even.  
- Therefore, this statement **alone is sufficient**.

---

### Step 4: Combine Statements (1) and (2)
- Statement (2) already guarantees sufficiency. Adding (1) doesn’t change that.  
- So, together they are also sufficient, but (2) alone is enough.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Statement (2) alone is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not.**  
That corresponds to **Answer Choice B** in GMAT-style Data Sufficiency.

---


## Q38
Let’s break this one down carefully:

We’re asked: **How many minutes long was the call?**

- Cost structure:  
  - First 3 minutes: $0.42$ each → total $3 \times 0.42 = 1.26$.  
  - Each additional minute: $0.18$.  
  - Total cost = $1.26 + 0.18(x - 3)$, for $x \geq 3$.

---

### Statement (1):  
*The charge for the first 3 minutes was $0.36 less than the charge for the remainder of the call.*

- First 3 minutes = $1.26$.  
- Remainder = $0.18(x - 3)$.  
- Condition: $1.26 = 0.18(x - 3) - 0.36$.  

Solve:  
$1.26 + 0.36 = 0.18(x - 3) \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1.62 = 0.18(x - 3)$  
$x - 3 = \frac{1.62}{0.18} = 9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 12$

So the call lasted **12 minutes**.  
Statement (1) is **sufficient**.

---

### Statement (2):  
*The total charge for the call was $2.88.*

Equation:  
$1.26 + 0.18(x - 3) = 2.88$  
$0.18(x - 3) = 1.62 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x - 3 = 9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 12$

So again, the call lasted **12 minutes**.  
Statement (2) is **sufficient**.

---

### Combining (1) and (2):  
Each statement alone already gives the unique answer $x = 12$.  
Together they are also sufficient, but not needed.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Each statement alone is sufficient.**  
That corresponds to **Answer Choice D** in GMAT-style Data Sufficiency.

---

## Q39


We want: **How many seconds did Car X take to cross the ½‑mile bridge?**

---

### Step 1: Express the relationship
- Time to cross = $\dfrac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}}$.  
- Distance = 0.5 miles.  
- We need Car X’s speed to compute its crossing time.

---

### Statement (1):  
*Car X drove onto the bridge exactly 3 seconds after Car Y, and drove off exactly 2 seconds after Car Y.*

- This tells us Car X took **1 second less** than Car Y to cross the bridge.  
- But we don’t know Car Y’s crossing time (or speed).  
- Without Car Y’s time, we cannot determine Car X’s time.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Statement (2):  
*Car Y traveled across the bridge at a constant speed of 30 mph.*

- Car Y’s time = $\dfrac{0.5}{30} \text{ hours} = \dfrac{1}{60} \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ seconds}$.  
- So Car Y took 60 seconds.  
- But this gives no information about Car X’s speed or time.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combine (1) and (2):  
- From (2): Car Y’s time = 60 seconds.  
- From (1): Car X’s time = Car Y’s time – 1 second = 59 seconds.  
- Now we know Car X’s crossing time exactly.  
- **Sufficient together.**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Statements (1) and (2) together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient.**  
That corresponds to **Answer Choice C** in GMAT-style Data Sufficiency.

---


## Q40

We want to know: **Is $ \frac{p}{q} < 1$?**  
Equivalently: Is $p < q$? (since both are positive).

---

### Statement (1): $p < 4$  
- This only tells us that $p$ is less than 4.  
- But we don’t know anything about $q$.  
- Example: If $p = 3$ and $q = 10$, then $p/q < 1$.  
- If $p = 3$ and $q = 2$, then $p/q > 1$.  
- So **insufficient**.

---

### Statement (2): $q < 4$  
- This only tells us that $q$ is less than 4.  
- But we don’t know anything about $p$.  
- Example: If $p = 2$ and $q = 3$, then $p/q < 1$.  
- If $p = 5$ and $q = 3$, then $p/q > 1$.  
- So **insufficient**.

---

### Combine (1) and (2):  
- Now we know $p < 4$ and $q < 4$.  
- But this still doesn’t guarantee whether $p < q$.  
- Example: $p = 2, q = 3 \Rightarrow p/q < 1$.  
- Example: $p = 3, q = 2 \Rightarrow p/q > 1$.  
- So **still insufficient**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Statements (1) and (2) together are not sufficient.**  
That corresponds to **Answer Choice E** in GMAT-style Data Sufficiency.

## Q41

We want: **How many machines (A, B, C) are working in that minute?**

---

### Step 1: Recall machine rates
- Type A: 400 cans/minute  
- Type B: 600 cans/minute  
- Type C: 2,400 lids/minute  
- Each filled can must get a lid → total cans filled = total lids installed.

Let $a, b, c$ = number of machines of type A, B, C.  
Then:  
$400a + 600b = 2400c$

---

### Statement (1): A total of 4,800 cans are filled that minute
$400a + 600b = 4800$

So the total cans filled = 4,800.  
But we don’t know how many lids were installed (how many C machines).  
Example: If $a=12, b=0$, then 12 A machines. If $a=0, b=8$, then 8 B machines.  
Both satisfy 4,800 cans, but the number of machines differs.  
So **insufficient**.

---

### Statement (2): For that minute, there are 2 Type B machines for every Type C machine
$b = 2c$

But without knowing the total cans filled, we can’t determine $a$.  
Example: If $c=1, b=2$, then lids installed = 2,400. Cans filled must equal 2,400, but we don’t know how many A machines are involved.  
So **insufficient**.

---

### Combine (1) and (2):
From (1): $400a + 600b = 4800$.  
From (2): $b = 2c$.  
Also, cans filled = lids installed → $400a + 600b = 2400c$.

Now substitute:  
$4800 = 2400c \quad \Rightarrow \quad c = 2$  
$b = 2c = 4$  
$400a + 600(4) = 4800 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 400a + 2400 = 4800 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 400a = 2400 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = 6$

So:  
- $a = 6$ (Type A)  
- $b = 4$ (Type B)  
- $c = 2$ (Type C)  

Total machines = $6 + 4 + 2 = 12$.

Thus, together the statements are **sufficient**.

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Statements (1) and (2) together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient.**  
That corresponds to **Answer Choice C** in GMAT-style Data Sufficiency.

## Q42



We want: **Coordinates of point R** given that triangles $ \triangle OPQ $ and $ \triangle QRS $ have equal area.

---

### Step 1: Interpret the setup
- $O$ is the origin $(0,0)$.  
- $P, Q, R, S$ are points in the coordinate plane.  
- We’re told the two triangles have equal area.  
- To solve, we need enough information to pin down $R$.

---

### Statement (1): $P = (0,12)$  
- This fixes point $P$.  
- But we still don’t know where $Q, R, S$ are.  
- Equal area condition alone isn’t enough to determine $R$.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): $OP = OQ$ and $QS = RS$  
- $OP = OQ$ means $P$ and $Q$ are equidistant from the origin.  
- $QS = RS$ means $R$ and $S$ are symmetric with respect to $Q$.  
- This gives geometric relationships, but without coordinates for $P$, we can’t calculate exact positions.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combine (1) and (2):  
- From (1), $P = (0,12)$.  
- From (2), $OP = OQ$. Since $OP = 12$, $OQ = 12$.  
  → So $Q$ lies on the circle centered at origin with radius 12.  
- Equal area condition ties $\triangle OPQ$ and $\triangle QRS$.  
- With $QS = RS$, symmetry fixes $R$ relative to $Q$ and $S$.  
- Together, these constraints are enough to uniquely determine $R$.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Statements (1) and (2) together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient.**  
That corresponds to **Answer Choice C** in GMAT-style Data Sufficiency.

## Q43


We want: **Total number of games Team A won.**

---

### Step 1: Break down the situation
- Team A played 20 games initially.  
- It won 50% of those → $20 \times 0.5 = 10$ wins.  
- After that, it won **all remaining games**.  
- So total wins = $10 + \text{(remaining games)}$.  
- To solve, we need to know how many games were played in total.

---

### Statement (1): Team A played 25 games altogether
- Total games = 25.  
- Remaining games = $25 - 20 = 5$.  
- Team A won all 5 of those.  
- Total wins = $10 + 5 = 15$.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): Team A won 60% of all the games it played
- Let total games = $N$.  
- Wins = $0.6N$.  
- But we also know wins = $10 + (N - 20)$.  
  $  0.6N = 10 + (N - 20) = N - 10$  
  $0.6N = N - 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 0.4N = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad N = 25$  
- So total wins = $0.6 \times 25 = 15$.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Combine (1) and (2):  
Each statement alone already gives the unique answer (15 wins).  
Together they are also sufficient, but not needed.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Each statement alone is sufficient.**  
That corresponds to **Answer Choice D** in GMAT-style Data Sufficiency.

## Q44

This is a classic number theory puzzle. To determine if the product  is a multiple of 8, we need to look at the "evenness" of these three consecutive integers.

### The Core Principle

In any set of three consecutive integers , there are only two possible patterns for even (E) and odd (O) numbers:

1. **Odd, Even, Odd** (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
2. **Even, Odd, Even** (e.g., 2, 3, 4)

For the product  to be a multiple of 8, the total "count" of factors of 2 across all three numbers must be at least three (since ).

---

### Evaluating Statement (1): The product  is even.

If the product of  and  is even, at least one of them must be even.

* In the **Odd, Even, Odd** pattern, both  and  are odd, so  would be odd. This pattern is ruled out.
* In the **Even, Odd, Even** pattern, both  and  are even, so  is even. This matches the statement.

In the **Even, Odd, Even** pattern:

* Since  and  are consecutive even numbers (like 2 and 4, or 4 and 6), one of them **must** be a multiple of 4.
* The other even number provides at least one factor of 2.
* Combined (), the product  will always be a multiple of 8.

**Statement (1) is SUFFICIENT.**

---

### Evaluating Statement (2): The product  is a multiple of 4.

Let’s test our two possible patterns:

* **Pattern 1 (Odd, Even, Odd):** Let $a=1,b=2,c=3$. Here $bc=6$, which is **not** a multiple of 4. This pattern is ruled out.
* **Pattern 2 (Even, Odd, Even):** Let $a=2,b=3,c=4$. Here $bc=12$, which **is** a multiple of 4. In this case, $abc=24$, which is a multiple of 8.

Wait, let's check if Pattern 1 could ever work. If $b$ is even and $c$ is odd, for $bc$ to be a multiple of 4, $b$ itself must be a multiple of 4 (since  contributes no factors of 2).

* If $b=4$, then $a=3$ and $c=5$.
* Product $abc=3×4×5=60$. Is 60 a multiple of 8? **No.**

Now we have a conflict:

* If $a=2$, $b=3$, $c=4$, the answer is **Yes**.
* If $a=3$, $b=4$, $c=5$, the answer is **No**.

**Statement (2) is NOT SUFFICIENT.**

---

### Conclusion

Since Statement (1) guarantees the **Even, Odd, Even** pattern (which always results in a multiple of 8), but Statement (2) allows for both "Yes" and "No" scenarios, the answer is **A**.

## Q45


We want: **How many businesses did not report a net profit nor invest in foreign markets?**

---

### Step 1: Define sets
- Total businesses = 30.  
- Profit group = 21.  
- Foreign investment group = 15.  
- We want the number outside both groups (neither profit nor foreign).  
- Formula:  
  $ \text{Neither} = 30 - (\text{Profit} + \text{Foreign} - \text{Both})$  
So we need the intersection (“Both”).

---

### Statement (1): 12 businesses reported both profit and foreign investment
- Profit + Foreign – Both = $21 + 15 - 12 = 24$.  
- Neither = $30 - 24 = 6$.  
- We can determine the exact number.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): 24 businesses reported profit or foreign investment (or both)
- Profit ∪ Foreign = 24.  
- So Neither = $30 - 24 = 6$.  
- We can determine the exact number.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Combine (1) and (2):  
Each statement alone already gives the answer (6).  
Together they are also sufficient, but not needed.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Each statement alone is sufficient.**  
That corresponds to **Answer Choice D** in GMAT-style Data Sufficiency.

## Q46


We want: **Is $n$ closer to 50 than to 75?**

---

### Step 1: Translate the question  
- “Closer to 50 than to 75” means:  
  $|n - 50| < |n - 75|$.  
- Equivalently: $n < 62.5$.  
So the question is: **Is $n < 62.5$?**

---

### Statement (1): $75 - n > n - 50$  
$75 - n > n - 50 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 125 > 2n \quad \Rightarrow \quad n < 62.5$  
This directly tells us that $n$ is less than 62.5, i.e., closer to 50.  
**Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): $n > 60$  
- If $n = 61$, then it’s closer to 50 (distance 11 vs. 14).  
- If $n = 70$, then it’s closer to 75 (distance 20 vs. 5).  
- So depending on the value, $n$ could be closer to 50 or to 75.  
**Insufficient.**

---

### Combine (1) and (2):  
- Statement (1) alone already gives sufficiency.  
- Adding (2) doesn’t change that.  
- Still **sufficient**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Statement (1) alone is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not.**  
That corresponds to **Answer Choice A** in GMAT-style Data Sufficiency.

## Q47


We want: **What is the value of $t$, given $t = 2x(5n)$?**

---

### Step 1: Simplify the expression  
$t = 2x \cdot 5n = 10xn$  
So to find $t$, we need both $x$ and $n$.

---

### Statement (1): $x = n + 3$  
- Substituting:  
  $  t = 10x n = 10(n+3)n = 10(n^2 + 3n)$  
- This gives a formula for $t$, but without knowing $n$, we cannot get a single numeric value.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Statement (2): $2x = 32$  
- Then $x = 16$.  
- Substituting:  
  $  t = 10 \cdot 16 \cdot n = 160n$  
- Again, without knowing $n$, we cannot get a single numeric value.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Combine (1) and (2):  
- From (2): $x = 16$.  
- From (1): $x = n + 3$.  
- So $n = 13$.  
- Substituting:  
  $  t = 10 \cdot 16 \cdot 13 = 2080$  
- Now we have a unique value for $t$.  
- **Sufficient together.**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Statements (1) and (2) together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient.**  
That corresponds to **Answer Choice C** in GMAT-style Data Sufficiency.

## Q48


We want: **The ratio of cars to trucks produced by Company X last year.**

---

### Step 1: Define variables  
- Let $C$ = number of cars.  
- Let $T$ = number of trucks.  
- We want $C:T$.

---

### Statement (1):  
*If cars had been 8% greater, then cars = 150% of trucks.*  

So:  
$1.08C = 1.5T$  
$\frac{C}{T} = \frac{1.5}{1.08} = \frac{150}{108} = \frac{25}{18}$  

This gives the exact ratio of cars to trucks.  
**Sufficient.**

---

### Statement (2):  
*Company X produced 565,000 cars and 406,800 trucks.*  

So:  
$\frac{C}{T} = \frac{565{,}000}{406{,}800}$  

Simplify:  
Divide numerator and denominator by 100 → $\frac{5650}{4068}$.  
Both divisible by 2 → $\frac{2825}{2034}$.  
This fraction cannot be reduced further.  
So ratio = $2825:2034$.  
**Sufficient.**

---

### Combine (1) and (2):  
Each statement alone already gives the ratio.  
Together they are also sufficient, but not needed.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Each statement alone is sufficient.**  
That corresponds to **Answer Choice D** in GMAT-style Data Sufficiency.

## Q52

We want: **the amount Elena spent on newspapers** given her total spending was \$720.

---

### Statement (1)  
- Magazines = 80% of books.  
- So if books = $(B)$, magazines = $(0.8B)$.  
- Newspapers = $(N)$.  
- Total: $(N + B + 0.8B = 720 \implies N + 1.8B = 720)$.  
- Two unknowns, one equation. Cannot solve for $(N)$.  
- **Insufficient.**

---

### Statement (2)  
- Newspapers = 60% of (magazines + books).  
- So $N = 0.6(M + B)$.  
- Total: $N + M + B = 720$.  
- Substitute: $0.6(M+B) + (M+B) = 720 \implies 1.6(M+B) = 720$.  
- So $M+B = 450$.  
- Then $N = 0.6(450) = 270$.  
- Unique value for newspapers.  
- **Sufficient.**

---

### Combining  
- Statement (2) alone already gives the answer.  
- Statement (1) is not needed.

---

### Correct Answer Choice:  
**(B)** — Statement (2) alone is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not.
